# SHM2Opt
A module for generating synthetic corrosion data and obtain a 2D optimal layout of sensors over a pipeline surface

Probabilsitic Sampling methods are used in R language to generate damage samples.
Constraint K-means is employed to cluster gnerated damages of samples using Python. 
Mixed integer programming techniques are used in GAMS optimization language to formulate the optmization problem.
Please read SHM2Opt Instruction Manual for more info.
